# MCMC_Lightning_Talk
Materials for a 'lightning talk' I delivered as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive.

The goal is to explain a technical topic to a non-technical audience, using as little jargon as possible. In this presentation, I try to explain why MCMC methods are used, and to develop the intuitions behind how they work. 

My slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LLjHTXjAWcjcx4af9NpVCZFhR5r8KxBMQq7gb4iSqig/edit?usp=sharing). 
A notebook accompanying these slides can be found [here](https://github.com/bpshaver/MCMC_Lightning_Talk/blob/master/MCMC_Lightning_Talk.ipynb).
